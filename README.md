Create a login popup that will log you in for the current session. And only appear when the user hasn't
logged in yet for the current session.
The login form should consist of a username and password which must comply to the following password
security requirements:
Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc , cde , fgh ,
and so on, up to xyz . They cannot skip letters; acd doesn't count.
Passwords may not contain the letters i, O, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters
and are therefore confusing.
Passwords must contain at least two non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or cc.
Passwords cannot be longer than 32 characters.
